		<h1>Git Tutorial</h1>
		<h2>What is Git?</h2>
		<p>Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.</p>
		<p>It is used for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Git helps you keep track of code changes.</li>
			<li>Tracking who made changes</li>
			<li>Git is used to collaborate on code.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What does Git do?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Manage projects with <strong>Repositories</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Clone</strong> a project to work on a local copy</li>
			<li>Control and track changes with <strong>Staging</strong> and <strong>Committing</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Branch</strong> and <strong>Merge</strong> to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project</li>
			<li><strong>Pull</strong> the latest version of the project to a local copy</li>
			<li><strong>Push</strong> local updates to the main project</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Working with Git</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository</li>
			<li>Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on and creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder</li>
			<li>When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified</li>
			<li>You select the modified files you want to Stage</li>
			<li>The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files</li>
			<li>Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.</li>
			<li>You can revert back to any previous commit.</li>
			<li>Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Why Git?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Over 70% of developers use Git!</li>
			<li>Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.</li>
			<li>Developers can see the full history of the project.</li>
			<li>Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>GitHub is a remote repository platform.</li>
			<li>Git and GitHub are different things.</li>
			<li>GitHub makes tools that use Git.</li>
			<li>GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Using Git with Command Line</h2>
		<p>To start using Git, we are first going to open up our Command shell.</p>
		<p>For Windows, you can use <strong>Git Bash</strong>, which comes included in Git for Windows. For Mac and Linux you can use the built-in terminal.</p>
		<h2>Configure Git</h2>
		<p>Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:</p>
		<p>I think is better to use SSH to link gitHub with the local git, the commits will be done with the gitHub user and not mixed with local user commits.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.</p>
		<p>If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ git config --global user.name "w3schools-test"</code><br>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ git config --global user.email "test@w3schools.com"</code>
		<h2>Initialize Git</h2>
		<p>If you already have a folder/directory you would like to use for Git:</p>
		<p>Navigate to it in command line, or open it in your file explorer, right-click and select "Git Bash here"</p>
		<p>Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder with the command <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> init.</p>
		<h2>Git Adding New Files</h2>
		<p>You just created your first local Git repo with the command git init. But it is empty.</p>
		<p>So let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite text editor.</p>
		
		<p>After add files to the git repo folder, now Git is <strong>aware</strong> of the file, but has not <strong>added</strong> it to our repository!</p>
		<p>Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository</li>
			<li>Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.</p>
		
		<h2>Git Staging Environment</h2>
		<p>One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging Environment, and the Commit.</p>
		<p>As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment.</p>
		<p>Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. You will learn more about commit shortly.</p>
		<p><strong style="color: crimson">README.md</strong> file that describes the repository (recommended for all repositories):
		<h2>Git Commit</h2>
		<p>Since we have finished our work, we are ready to move from <strong style="color: crimson">stage</strong> to <strong style="color: crimson">commit</strong> for our repo.</p>
		<p>Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. Git considers each <strong style="color: crimson">commit</strong> change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.</p>
		<h2>Git Commit without Stage</h2>
		<p>Sometimes, when you make small changes, using the staging environment seems like a waste of time. It is possible to commit changes directly, skipping the staging environment (without using the git add command). The -a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file.</p>
		<h2>Working with Git Branches</h2>
		<p>In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.</p>
		<p>Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.</p>
		<p>We are working in our local repository, and we do not want to disturb or possibly wreck the main project.</p>
		<p>When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.</p>
		<p>You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.</p>
		<p>Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!</p>
		<h2>Pulling to Keep up-to-date with Changes</h2>
		<p>When working as a team on a project, it is important that everyone stays up to date.</p>
		<p>Any time you start working on a project, you should get the most recent changes to your local copy.</p>
		<p>With Git, you can do that with <strong style="color: crimson">pull</strong>.</p>
		<p><strong style="color: crimson">pull</strong> is a combination of 2 different commands:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong style="color: crimson">fetch</strong></li>
			<li><strong style="color: crimson">merge</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.</p>
		<p>That is how you keep your local Git up to date from a remote repository (using fetch/merge or pull).</p>
		<h2>GitHub Send Pull Request</h2>
		<p>If you click the "Compare & pull request", you can go through the changes made and new files added</p>
		<p>A pull request is how you propose changes. You can ask some to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch.</p>
		<h2>Git GitHub Work Flow</h2>
		<p>The GitHub flow is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitHub.</p>
		<p>It focuses on branching and makes it possible for teams to experiment freely, and make deployments regularly. (CI/CD)</p>
		<p>The GitHub workflow works like this:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new Branch</li>
			<li>Make changes and add Commits</li>
			<li>Open a Pull Request</li>
			<li>Review</li>
			<li>Deploy</li>
			<li>Merge</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Create a New Branch</h2>
		<p>Branching is the key concept in Git. And it works around the rule that the master branch is ALWAYS deployable.</p>
		<p>That means, if you want to try something new or experiment, you create a new branch! Branching gives you an environment where you can make changes without affecting the main branch.</p>
		<p>When your new branch is ready, it can be reviewed, discussed, and merged with the main branch when ready.</p>
		<p>When you make a new branch, you will (almost always) want to make it from the master branch.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that you are working with others. Using descriptive names for new branches, so everyone can understand what is happening.</p>
		<h2>Make Changes and Add Commits</h2>
		<p>After the new branch is created, it is time to get to work. Make changes by adding, editing and deleting files. Whenever you reach a small milestone, add the changes to your branch by commit.</p>
		<p>Adding commits keeps track of your work. Each commit should have a message explaining what has changed and why. Each commit becomes a part of the history of the branch, and a point you can revert back to if you need to.</p>
		<div style="background-color: #ffffcc">
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> commit messages are very important! Let everyone know what has changed and why. Messages and comments make it so much easier for yourself and other people to keep track of changes.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Open a Pull Request</h2>
		<p>Pull requests are a key part of GitHub. A Pull Request notifies people you have changes ready for them to consider or review.</p>
		<p>You can ask others to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch.</p>
		<h2>Review</h2>
		<p>When a Pull Request is made, it can be reviewed by whoever has the proper access to the branch. This is where good discussions and review of the changes happen.</p>
		<p>Pull Requests are designed to allow people to work together easily and produce better results together!</p>
		<p>If you receive feedback and continue to improve your changes, you can push your changes with new commits, making further reviews possible.</p>
		<div style="background-color: #ffffcc">
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> GitHub shows new commit and feedback in the "unified Pull Request view".</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Deploy</h2>
		<p>When the pull request has been reviewed and everything looks good, it is time for the final testing. GitHub allows you to deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging with the master branch.</p>
		<p>If any issues arise, you can undo the changes by deploying the master branch into production again!</p>
		<div style="background-color: #ffffcc">
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Teams often have dedicated testing environments used for deploying branches.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Merge</h2>
		<p>After exhaustive testing, you can merge the code into the master branch!</p>
		<p>Pull Requests keep records of changes to your code, and if you commented and named changes well, you can go back and understand why changes and decisions were made.</p>
		<div style="background-color: #ffffcc">
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can add keywords to your pull request for easier searching!</p>
		</div>
		
		
		
		<h3>Git commands:</h3>
		<p>Check if Git is properly installed:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ git --version</code><br>
		<code>git version 2.35.1.windows.2</code>
		<p>Initialize/Create a Git repository:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> init</code><br>
		<code>Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/</code>
		<p><strong style="color: crimson">ls</strong> will list the files in the directory.</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> status</code><br>
		<p>Add a file to the Staging Environment:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git add</strong> index.html</code><br>
		<p>Stage more than one file at a time:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git add</strong> .</code><br>
		<p>Add all files in the current directory to the Staging Environment:</p>
		<p>Using <strong style="color: crimson">--all</strong> instead of individual filenames will stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted) files.</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git add</strong> --all</code><br>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> The shorthand command for git add --all is git add -A</p>
		<p>The <strong style="color: crimson">commit</strong> command performs a commit, and the <strong style="color: crimson">-m "message"</strong> adds a message.</p>
		<p>When we commit, we should always include a message.</p>
		<p>By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when.</p>
		<p>The Staging Environment has been committed to our current repository, with the message: "First release of Hello World!"</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> commit -m <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">"First release of Hello World!"</strong></code><br>
		<p>To check the status of our repository, to see the changes in a more compact way we will use the --short option:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> status --short</code>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Short status flags are:</p>
		<p>?? - Untracked files</p>
		<p>A - Files added to stage</p>
		<p>M - Modified files</p>
		<p>D - Deleted files</p>
		<p>Commit files directly skipping the Staging Environment (not generally recommended)</p>
		<p>Skipping the stage step can sometimes make you include unwanted changes.</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> commit -a -m <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">"Updated index.html with a new line"</strong></code>
		<p>To view the history/log of commits for a repository</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> log</code>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> log origin/master</code>
		<h2>Git Help</h2>
		<p>If you are having trouble remembering commands or options for commands, you can use Git <strong style="color: crimson">help</strong>.</p>
		<p>There are a couple of different ways you can use the <strong style="color: crimson">help</strong> command in command line:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong style="color: crimson">git command -help</strong> -  Any time you need some help remembering  all the available options for the specific command</li>
			<li><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use <strong style="color: crimson">--help</strong> instead of <strong style="color: crimson">-help</strong> to open the relevant Git manual page</li>
			<li><strong style="color: crimson">git help --all</strong> -  To list all possible commands, Warning: This will display a very long list of commands</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Create a new <strong style="color: crimson">branch</strong></p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> branch hello-world-images</code>
		<p>Confirm that we have created a new branch (list branches)</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> branch</code>
		<p><strong style="color: crimson">checkout</strong> is the command used to check out a <strong style="color: crimson">branch</strong>. Moving us <strong>from</strong> the current branch, <strong>to</strong> the one specified at the end of the command</p>
		<p>Now we have moved our current workspace from the master branch, to the new branch</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> checkout hello-world-images</code>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the <strong style="color: crimson">-b</strong> option on checkout will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exist</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> checkout -b emergency-fix</code>
		<h2>Merge Branches</h2>
		<p>merge the current branch (master) with emergency-fix</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> merge emergency-fix</code>
		<p>Since the emergency-fix branch came directly from master, and no other changes had been made to master while we were working, Git sees this as a continuation of master. So it can "Fast-forward", just pointing both master and emergency-fix to the same commit.</p>
		<p>Delete branch</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> branch -d emergency-fix</code>
		<p>git remote add origin URL specifies that you are adding a remote repository, with the specified URL, as an origin to your local Git repo.<p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> remote add origin git@github.com:Jjimenez87/knowlege-garage-repo.git</code>
		<p>Use git push to send files to remote repo.</p>
		<p>Push our master branch to the origin url, and set it as the default remote branch</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> push --set-upstream origin master</code>
		<p>Push the current branch to its default remote origin</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> push origin</code>
		<p>Push a branch from local Git repository, to GitHub, where everyone can see the changes:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> push origin update-readme</p>
		<h2>Git Fetch</h2>
		<p>fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.</p>
		<p>So, on your local Git, fetch updates to see what has changed on GitHub</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git</strong> fetch origin</code>
		<p>Verify by showing the differences between our local master and origin/master</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git diff</strong> origin/master</code>
		<h2>Git Merge used after fetch</h2>
		<p>merge combines the current branch, with a specified branch.</p>
		<p>We have confirmed that the updates are as expected, and we can merge our current branch (master) with origin/master:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git </strong> merge origin/master</code>
		<p>But what if you just want to update your local repository, without going through all those steps (fetch and merge)?
		<p>Use pull to update our local Git:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git </strong> pull origin</code>
		<h2>Pulling a Branch from GitHub</h2>
		<p>Lets pull from our GitHub repository again so that our code is up-to-date:</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git </strong> pull</code>
		<p>use the -a option to see all local and remote branches</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> branch -r is for remote branches only.</p>
		<code>[user@localhost]$ <strong style="color: #2f9c0a">git </strong> branch -a</code>
