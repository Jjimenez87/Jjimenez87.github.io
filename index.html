		<p>I am Juan Bernardo Jimenez Perez ... I live in Aguascalientes, Mexico, I am married and I have a 2 years daughter so far.</p>
		<p>I like MTB I enjoy a lot to ride my bicycle, I love video games but due to my responsabilities I do not play very often.</p>
		<p>I like trance music my favorite DJs is Above & Beyond. I started this page on December 2, 2024, to practice and write down notes
		about technologies I am studying and learn with hands on experience.</p>
		<p>I am not the best developer in the world but I would like to become in the best, for different reasons I haven't had an steady path only
		with Java ecosystem 100%, but I have worked with other tools like MuleSoft, Twilio, AEM and this experience has helped me to discover
		what I really like and I think I like to wotk more with Java, Spring and different tools used in the Java Development ecosystem.</p>
