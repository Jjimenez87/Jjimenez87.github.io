		<h2>Programming Paradigms</h2>
		<p>Programming Paradigms are ways or styles of writing code, their are not programming languages.<p>
		<p>Classify programming languages based on the paradigms they support:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Smalltak, support a single paradigm (OOP)</li>
			<li>Ruby,Python,Java, JavaScript support multiple paradigms<li>
		</ul>
		<p>In computer science we have various programming paradigms, or styles of programming.</p>
		<p>like procedural, functional, object-oriented, event-driven, logic, aspect-oriented, and so on.</p>
		<p>Out of all these object-oriented and functional are the 2 most popular paradigms we use these days</p>
		<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
		<p>In OOP, everything is based on the concept of objects</p>
		<p>these objects interact with each other to perform various tasks</p>
		<p>These objects are units that contain some data (state), and operations on the data (methods/behaviour)</p>
		<p>These are the methods or functions that modify the data</p>
		<p>what programming paradigm is the best? The answer is, it depends on the problem, you're trying to solve</p>
		<p>Both object-oriented and functional programming are great and have benefits. But neither work best in all situations</p>
		<p>One of the major issue we have in the software industry these days is that developers are more excited about languages, tools, frameworks</p>
		<p>than solving problems, problem solving is the process of defining a problem, identifying and comparing different solutions,</p>
		<p>and picking the one that best solves that problem with respect to the context and constraints.</p>
		<p>Take some poorly written code and <strong>Refactor</strong> it into clean and maintainable, reusable and object oriented code is a critical skill that</p>
		<p>every Java Developer must have</p>
		<p>Benefits of OOP</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reduced Complexity</li>
			<li>Easier Maintenance</li>
			<li>Code Reuse</li>
			<li>Faster Development</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>OOP Principles</h2>
		<p>Encapsulation</p>
		<p>Abstraction</p>
		<p>Inheritance</p>
		<p>Polymorphism</p>
		<p>Coupling or dependency between classes, problems with tightly coupled code, you can solve these problems with Interfaces (the most powerful, but the least understood feature of object oriented programming)</p>
